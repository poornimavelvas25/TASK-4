1.What is a Firewall?

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network (such as the internet).
Its main purpose is to prevent unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication.

2.Why Firewall is Important?

Prevents unauthorized access
Blocks malicious traffic
Protects open ports and services
Reduces risk of hacking attempts
Controls data flow between networks

3.Types of Firewalls

1.Packet Filtering Firewall
Examines packets based on:
IP address
Port number
Protocol (TCP/UDP)
Simple and fast
Less secure compared to modern firewalls

2.Stateful Inspection Firewall
Tracks active connections
Makes decisions based on connection state
More secure than packet filtering

3.Proxy Firewall (Application-Level Firewall)

Acts as an intermediary between client and server
Inspects application-layer traffic
Provides higher security

4.Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

Includes advanced features like:
Deep packet inspection
Intrusion prevention
Malware detection

4.How a Firewall Works

When data travels across a network:
The firewall inspects the packet.
It compares packet details with existing rules.
If traffic matches an allow rule → It is permitted.
If traffic matches a deny rule → It is blocked.

5.Firewalls filter traffic based on:

Source IP address
Destination IP address
Port number
Protocol
Direction (Inbound/Outbound)
